            <h2>The Roberto Carlos Free Kick: A Breakdown Of The Impossible Goal </h2>
            <blockquote cite="https://jobsinfootball.com/blog/roberto-carlos-free-kick/"> 
                Roberto Carlos — Number 3 for Real Madrid and 6 for Brazil —  is widely known as one of the most attack-minded defenders of all time. He typically played as a left-back or left wing-back, and his offensive prowess helped to redefine the role of the full-back in modern soccer, placing greater emphasis on getting up the pitch and linking up with midfielders and forwards. He was also famous for his incredible set pieces; Carlos' ability from free kicks and corners allowed him to rack up 97 goals and 126 assists in 756 club appearances over the course of his career, a remarkable amount for a so-called "defender"
